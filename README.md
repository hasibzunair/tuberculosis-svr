### Tuberculosis severity estimation

Code for paper titled *Tuberculosis Severity Estimation from
Volumetric CT scans using Uniformizing Techniques and 3D Convolutional Networks*.


This work is evaluated on CLEF evaluation: ImageCLEF 2019 Tuberculosis - Severity scoring challenge.The challenge was dedicated to the analysis of 3D Computed Tomography (CT) image data of tuberculosis (TB) patients.

### Usage

This work is implemented in Python 3.6 and Keras using Tensorflow as backend.

### Dependencies

Tested code using:

*    Ubuntu 14.04
*    Windows 8
*    Python 3.6

### Directory Structure & Usage
* `main`: Contains codes to replicate experiments
* `others`: Contains helper codes to preprocess and visualize samples in dataset.

### Post challenge submission

Our approach attains 5-th position overall.
